        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Litigation finance is a growing market, but the process of connecting cases with capital remains inefficient. Law firms spend weeks preparing materials for each potential funder. Funders wade through misaligned opportunities. Both sides waste time on conversations that go nowhere.</p>
        <p>The market lacks structure. There's no standardized way to present cases, no controlled environment for evaluation, and no clear process for moving from interest to commitment.</p>

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>CaseFin introduces structure where there was none. We've built a platform that standardizes how cases are presented, controls how they're accessed, and clarifies how decisions progress.</p>
        <p>For law firms, this means presenting a case once and reaching multiple funders without redundant work. For funders, it means seeing only opportunities that match their criteria, with information organized for efficient evaluation.</p>
        <p>We're not trying to replace relationships—we're trying to remove the friction that makes building them so costly.</p>

          <h3>Structure Creates Clarity</h3>
          <p>When information is organized consistently, decisions become easier. We design for clarity at every step.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="value-item">
          <h3>Control Builds Trust</h3>
          <p>Both sides need to feel in control of what they share and when. Permissions aren't a feature—they're foundational.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="value-item">
          <h3>Efficiency Serves Everyone</h3>
          <p>Time wasted on misaligned conversations is time neither side gets back. We optimize for signal over noise.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="value-item">
          <h3>Discipline Over Speed</h3>
          <p>Moving fast matters less than moving right. We build for the long term, not the next quarter.</p>
